# Game

The title is a lie, this is not a game, its a game-engine-esque playground. I try to write what I can without the use of libraries.

## Libraries Used
- [DirectXMath](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXMath)

## Assets

Assets aren't in the `data` folder because of their large size. Reach me on discord if you would like them.

## Features

 - [x] GLTF Support
 - [ ] Cascading Directional Shadow Maps
 - [ ] Physically based shading
 - [ ] Lightmapped static indirect lighting
 - [ ] Box-projected reflection probes
 - [ ] Other stuff planned
